  <h3>Zero waste</h3>
  <p>When i was traveling i always do these thing called "zero waste".</p>
  <p>To put it simpely zerowaste was like eating food but without container made with plastic or can and etc, So we mostly eat home cooked food and use something called tuperware.</p>
  <P>When i first know zero waste is when i attend Acara nol sampah By kak Siska, And I was like "Oh so this kind of things really is exist!, I should start doing it".</P>

<h3>Traveling</h3>  
<p>I do a lot of Traveling at least once in two months, Or once in a week that's when i go alone to a park and some new places.</p>
<p>when my family and i go Traveling we would mostly go camping then go to a hotel, Little funny story we never go camping in a beach so one day we decided it would be a good idea to go camping on a beach.</p>
<p>And oh my god it was really hot in there i was like already on my tantrum, So i just stayed in my car, But even tough i was in the car it still feels really really hot so i just deal with it, On 7 pm we finnaly decided to just camp on the usual place.</p>
