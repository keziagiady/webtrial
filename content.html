<h3>Traveling</h3>  
<p>So i do a lot of Traveling at least once in two months.</p>
<p>when my family and i go Traveling we would mostly go camping then go to a hotel, Little funny story we never go camping in a beach so one day we decided it would be a good idea to go camping on a beach.</p>
<p>And oh my god it was really hot in there i was like already on my tantrum, So i just stay in my car, But even tough i was in the car it still feels really really hot so i just deal with it, On 7 pm we finnaly decided to just camp on the usual place.</p>
